(a) Correctness
    - Input-output format follows the design which inputs a username(str),
      a password(str) and outputs a str of message
    - The username and password are set to None in default which is needed in design
    - It is connected to Database which is defined in the class diagram
    - Conditional statements are correct and doesn't duplicate

(b) Coding Style
    - Variables are named clearly and easy to understand and follow
    - No indentation issue

(c) Coding Guidelines
    - Some lines are too long [line 92, 97], which confilts the pep8
    - No docstring

(d) Quality of Documentation
    - Not enough document in conditional statements [line 91]
    - Code is clearly and adequately documented (both file prologues and module headers)
    - Commenting style is maintained and easy to follow

(e) Quality of Testing
    - No testing, since these files are about the UI.

Summary:
 - The correctness was great, no conflicts with the design and no waste of the memory.
 - The coding style was great, variables were meaningful and easy to follow.
 - The coding guideline was bad.Some lines are too long [line 92, 97],
   which confilts the pep8.Also, there is no docstring.
 - The quality of documentation was good. Commenting style is maintained and easy to follow,
   but there is lack of document in conditional statements [line 91].
 - Since all the reviewed codes were about the UI, it is hard to test it using the unittest.
