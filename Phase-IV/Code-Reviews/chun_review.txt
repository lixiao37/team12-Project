    functions:
	generate_twitter_relation_dict [line 438-451]
Code-Reviewer: Chun Cho
Code-Author: Zhen Jiang
Description of feature:
    - This feature is part of the user interface which
        gets data from the database and generates a
        dictionary which will store the sources as keys 
	and target counts for that source as values
(a) Correctness
    - Indexes are properly initialized for loops
    - Loop termination condition is correct, it ends when
      it finishes looping all of the sources
    - The dictionary and lists are within bound, properly used
    - There are no unused variables defined
    - Return statement returns the correct type as required,
      it never a non-dictionary type object
(b) Coding Style
    - Some lines of the code are way too long,
      eg. function generate_pie_graph - line 448 has 113 characters
      Needs a line break to split the lines
    - Indentation is consistent
    - Variable and function names make sense (correctly describe what they are)
(c) Coding Guidelines
    - Functions are named correctly according to the guidelines agreed upon
    - Variables defined in the functions are named correctly and 
      consistently with an underscore to separate words. eg relation_dict
(d) Quality of Documentation
    - There are NO comments at all for this function
        - Although I understand the code due to my understanding
	  of the program overall, an outsider would be confused
	  as there are no comments to describe anything.
	- Even though documentation is missing, the variable
	  names are straight forward and help with 
	  understanding the function.
    - There are NO doc string for the function
(e) Quality of Testing
    - No testing was done because this feature is part of the user interface

Summary:
    - The code returns a string as required and produces the correct output
      visually in the UI (shows pie graphs)
    - The code's styling is good/consistent and follows the conventions that
      we have agreed on as a group
    - The code needs more comments to describe the confusing parts,
      someone who did not work with this file will be confused when
      they are reading the code
    - The functions needs doc strings to describe what parameters are being
      passed in, what the funciton does and what it returns
