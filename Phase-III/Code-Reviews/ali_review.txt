Sections Reviewed: get_citation and get_meta_data
Code-Reviewer: Ali Mehdi(aka Muhammad Mehdi)
Code-Author: Alan Chan

(a) Correctness
    - In get_meta_data, it needs more checks for meta data
    - In extract_citation, the code needs to be broken further
	-> for example, extract_citation should not depend on other functions 
(b) Coding Style
    - Too many indentations in extract_citations
    - Code refactoration can be done in extract_citations 
(c) Coding Guidelines
    - Good use of naming convention, using pep8
    - Very close to 80 character line limit
(d) Quality of Documentation
    - Need more documentation in extract_citations, what does it do?
    - Same for get_meta_data, what does it return? Object type? 
(e) Quality of Testing
    - No test cases done.

Summary:
 - The overall correctness was correct. Except, the "extract_citation" needs 
   to be split into smaller functions, so that testing is done more
   more efficiently. The coding style was great, it was consistent with the
   pep8 coding styles. The code however needs more documentation and comments.
   There were no test-cases done, so the author needs to work more on that,
   since testing is an essential part of the development.
