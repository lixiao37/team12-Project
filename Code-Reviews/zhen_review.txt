(a) Correctness
   [line 235-267] generate_relation_dict
    - Code can run in unexpected cases
	- Case: no news_sources
	- Case: no news_targets
	- Case: article with no citation
    - Output is the same as the expected one when given the known input
	- Given the data in database, this function can generate a 
	  correct relation dictionary
    [line 206-221] generate_detailed_graph
    - Always returns a string
    - The bar graph is colored
    - The bar graph has a legend and is indeed based on the color of the bar
    - The data in the bar graph is related to the relation dictionary
    - The bar graph has a description to describe the details of the parameters

(b) Coding Style
    - Variables are named clearly and easy to understand and follow
    - Loop index variables are more meaningful than i
	- Only one index variable named i used to set up the index, which is good
    - Too much indentations in generate_relation_dict [line 248-266]

(c) Coding Guidelines
    - Some lines are too long [line 215, 217, 254, 263], which confilts the pep8
    - Docstring is outside the generate_relation_dict [line 235-240]

(d) Quality of Documentation
    - Complex algorithms are explained and justified but not in detail which 
      still confused me [line 257-258]
    - Code is clearly and adequately documented (both file prologues and module headers)
    - Commenting style is maintained and easy to follow

(e) Quality of Testing
    - No testing, since these files are about the UI.

Summary:
 - The correctness was great, the function could handle most of the unexpected cases and
   the detailed bar graph contained legend, different color as well as the description
   which were expected in the user story.
 - The coding style was good, variables and loop index were meaningful and easy to follow.
   The only unexpected thing was the indentations which were too much for the 
   generate_relation_dict function.
 - The coding guideline was bad. Some lines are too long [line 215, 217, 254, 263],
   which confilts the pep8 and docstring is outside the generate_relation_dict 
   [line 235-240].
 - The quality of documentation was good. Commenting style is maintained and easy to follow.
   Complex algorithms are explained and justified but not in detail which still confused 
   me [line 257-258].
 - Since all the reviewed codes were about the UI, it is hard to test it using the unittest.
