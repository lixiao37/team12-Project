Description of feature:
    - This feature is part of the user interface which
        gets data from the database and generates html code with
        pie graphs for the user to see
(a) Correctness
    - Function always returns a string as required,
      even if there is no graph generated
    - Given non empty data for the pie graph, 
      function generates html code for pie graphs and returns it
      as a string as required
    - Visual Correctness (How it looks in the user interface)
        - Pie Graph's data is correct
        - Pie Graph's colors are different
        - Pie Graph's sizes are proportional
        - Legend shows up correctly with the right numbers
        - The number of pie graphs that show up are correct
        - Sentence that describes the graph is correct
          (correct source name and target name / count)
(b) Coding Style
    - Some lines of the code are way too long,
      eg. function generate_pie_graph - line 190 has 176 characters
      and function generate_pie_graph - line 180 has 124 characters
      Needs a line break to split the lines
    - Indentation is consistent
    - Variable and function names make sense (correctly describe what they are)
(c) Coding Guidelines
    - Functions are named correctly according to the guidelines agreed upon
    - Variables defined in the functions are named correctly and 
      consistently with an underscore to seperate words. eg news_sources
(d) Quality of Documentation
    - There are comments for different parts of the functions
        - Comments are helpful, but there aren't enough made
          to describe confusing sections of the code
        - Comments are only made when it is necessary
        - Comments are consistently written
    - There are NO doc strings for both the functions
(e) Quality of Testing
    - No testing was done because this feature is part of the user interface

Summary:
    - The code returns a string as required and produces the correct output
      visually in the UI (shows pie graphs)
    - The code's styling is good/consistent and follows the conventions that
      we have agreed on as a group
    - The code needs more comments to describe the confusing parts,
      someone who did not work with this file will be confused when
      they are reading the code
    - The functions needs doc strings to describe what parameters are being
      passed in, what the funciton does and what it returns
