Seong-min:
For correctness, Ali made his functions work as intended. His coding style 
is easily readable due to spacing. Ali marginally followed the pep8 guildline, 
due to missing certain conventions in his code. The quality of Ali's 
documentation is decent and explains the purpose of a big chunk of code. All he 
needs to do is add few more lines of commenting and describe what happens when 
the data is already in the database or when connection to the database fails. 
Ali did not write any test cases.

Alan:
Code is present functions correctly and output was of expected format.
Code is easy for both other users to read and understand.
Code follows PEP8 coding conventions, minor format issues in get_screenshot.
Code comments and docstring provide descriptive detail to function flow.
No tests were available to test functions on.

Zhen:
- The correctness was great, the function could handle most of the unexpected 
  cases and the detailed bar graph contained legend, different color as well 
  as the description which were expected in the user story.
- The coding style was good, variables and loop index were meaningful and easy 
  to follow. The only unexpected thing was the indentations which were too much 
  for the generate_relation_dict function.
- The coding guideline was bad. 
  Some lines are too long [line 215, 217, 254, 263], which confilts the pep8 
  and docstring is outside the   generate_relation_dict [line 235-240].
- The quality of documentation was good. Commenting style is maintained and easy
  to follow. Complex algorithms are explained and justified but not in detail 
  which still confused me [line 257-258].
- Since all the reviewed codes were about the UI, it is hard to test it using 
  the unittest.

Chun:
- The code returns a string as required and produces the correct output
  visually in the UI (shows pie graphs)
- The code's styling is good/consistent and follows the conventions that
  we have agreed on as a group
- The code needs more comments to describe the confusing parts,
  someone who did not work with this file will be confused when
  they are reading the code
- The functions needs doc strings to describe what parameters are being
  passed in, what the funciton does and what it returns

Ali:
- The overall correctness was correct. Except, the "extract_citation" needs 
  to be split into smaller functions, so that testing is done more
  more efficiently. The coding style was great, it was consistent with the
  pep8 coding styles. The code however needs more documentation and comments.
  There were no test-cases done, so the author needs to work more on that,
  since testing is an essential part of the development.
